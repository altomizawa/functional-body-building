# Functional Body Building

This project is a web application designed to help users achieve functional fitness goals through structured workout plans, progress tracking, and potentially other features like nutritional guidance and community support. It's built using the Next.js framework and utilizes MongoDB for data storage.

## Project Overview

The core idea behind "Functional Body Building" is to move beyond traditional aesthetics-focused training and emphasize exercises that improve real-world strength, mobility, and overall physical capability. This application aims to provide users with:

*   **Personalized Workout Plans:** Tailored workout routines based on user goals, experience level, and available equipment.
*   **Exercise Library:** A comprehensive database of exercises with detailed descriptions, instructions, and video demonstrations.
*   **Progress Tracking:** Tools to log workouts, track progress, and visualize improvements over time.
*   **Potential Future Features:**
    *   Nutritional guidance and meal planning.
    *   Community forum for support and motivation.
    *   Integration with wearable devices for data collection.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building performant and scalable web applications.
    *   [React](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   [Geist](https://vercel.com/font): A font family for Vercel.
*   **Backend:**
    *   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database for storing user data, workout plans, and other application data.
    *   Potentially Next.js API routes for backend logic.
*   **Other:**
    *   `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun` as the package manager.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or later recommended) installed on your machine. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/.
*   **MongoDB:** You'll need a MongoDB database instance. You can use a local instance or a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas (which is referenced in the original file).
*   **Package Manager:** Choose your preferred package manager: `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd functional-body-building
    ```
    *(Replace `[repository-url]` with the actual URL of your project's Git repository.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using yarn
    yarn install

    # Using pnpm
    pnpm install

    # Using bun
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add the following environment variable, replacing the placeholder with your actual MongoDB connection string:
        ```
        MONGODB_URI='mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-address>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
        ```
        *   **Note:** The original file had `MONGODB_URI = 'mongodb+srv://altomizawa:SO9F3d4ziyfmW1rV@myatlasclusteredu.2gzg9xs.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=myAtlasClusterEDU'` as an example. You will need to replace the username, password, and cluster address with your own.

4. **Start the Development Server**
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run dev

    # Using yarn
    yarn dev

    # Using pnpm
    pnpm dev

    # Using bun
    bun dev
    ```

5.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the application.
